	<h2> Our Why </h2>
	<p>Have you ever been overwhelmed by the sheer number of fragrances out there on the market? Or was looking to give your loved one a fragrance but didn’t know where to start?</p>

	<p>We were once in the same sitiation when we started college. In a world where the fragrance industry has been centered around women, we found that it was difficult to find information online about men’s fragrances.</p> 

	<p>As a result, we set out to create an interactive, informative website where users can acquire tailored fragrance recommendations.Through intensive market research of fragrances, trends, and customer reviews, we narrow down the best fragrances we can recommend to our closest friends and family. By collecting and centralizing the currently scattered information about men’s fragrances we hope to help users smell the best in any occasion.</p>
